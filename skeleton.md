Layout when screen is less than 550px?

My first impression is that this is a mobile first design website.  This is indicate by the set min-width in CSS.

The content looks to be places in one column and many rows within sections.  Everything gets stack on top of each other.

As the screen expands that's when the min-width: 550px rule applies then min-width: 750px then 1000px.
